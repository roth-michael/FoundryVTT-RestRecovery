# What is Rest Recovery?

This module is a wholesale package that covers any and all mechanics relating to long and short rests, including (but not limited to);

* Class features, such as regaining spell slots through the Wizard's Arcane Recovery and automatic handling of Bard's Song of Rest
* HP Regaining through the Chef feat, and handling of the Tough feat and magic items such as the Periapt of Wound Closure
* Fully featured long rest settings with a multitude of **completely optional** features:
  * Rolling hit dice instead of regaining hit points
  * Partial recovery of spell slots, class features, and/or resources
  * Exhaustion automation
  * Food & water handling, tracking the sated status and starvation over time

The module continues to grow, and will expand further and further.
