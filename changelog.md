# Rest Recovery Changelog

## Version 5.0.3
- Fixed bug where hit die couldn't be selected during short rest
- Reordered prompt rest menu; the new order (rather than simply alphabetical is):
  - Actors with Player owners (Character or NPC)
  - Actors without Player owners, but with tokens on scene (Character or NPC)
  - Actors without Player owners and without tokens on scene (Character only)
  - Actors without Player owners and witohut tokens on scene (Character only)

## Version 5.0.2
- Fixed higher-level exhaustion icons not showing with One D&D Exhaustion enabled
- Added Czech translation (thanks Lethrendis)

## Version 5.0.1
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans)

## Version 5.0.0
- Requires system version 5.1.0 at minimum
- Prompted rests now make use of the system's new "Request" chat cards, rather than socketing a rest call directly to each connected client
- There is now a setting (on by default, to maintain existing behavior) to auto-start a rest for a user's selected "character" actor when such a chat card is created which contains that actor
- The rest prompt menu no longer allows you to specify a user for an actor; instead, if the above setting is enabled, the active user with an actor selected as their character will be prompted, otherwise if there are any active non-GM users who are owners of the actor, nobody will be prompted (whoever wishes to perform the rest can do so via the chat card), otherwise the GM is prompted
- Adjusted the "Enable Simple Calendar integration" setting to be "Enable calendar integration" instead, using the Core calendar implementation to determine whether it is a new day (in theory this should work with any calendar modules)
- Removed the "Prevent User Rest" setting, as the system now has a "Allow Individual Rests" setting
- Removed the "Automate Exhaustion" setting, as the system now handles automatic exhaustion recovery on rest, as well as disadvantage with legacy exhaustion rules (except for Attack disadvantage, which Rest Recovery will still handle)
- In order to not clobber somebody's custom exhaustion settings, toggling One D&D Exhaustion now requires a restart
- Restore food/water-patching behavior

## Version 4.0.3
- Ensure "automate exhaustion" setting is required for adding disadvantage to rolls

## Version 4.0.2
- Fixed bug with adding the rest button by the Item Piles trade request button

## Version 4.0.1
- Fixed bug where subclasses which granted spellcasting progression didn't allow for "arcane recovery"-style slot recovery
- Changed style of Prompt Rest button to look nice next to the Item Piles trade request button

## Version 4.0.0
- This version is _only_ compatible with V13+ (and therefore system version 5.0.0+)
- All UI has been moved from AppV1 Svelte to AppV2 Handlebars. This was a large undertaking, so there may be some issues, which I will endeavor to fix quickly
- Added support for the Arcane Grimoire item (increases Arcane Recovery spell slot level regain by 1)

## Version 3.3.1
- Fixed bug where hp recovery was capped to `hp.max` even if there was a `hp.tempmax` value

## Version 3.3.0
- Removed "Resource" recovery customization. Resources have long been deprecated - now they're gone (for Rest Recovery)
- Fixed bugs that arose in latest V13 build
- Fixed functionality on the dnd5e 5.0.0 prerelease

## Version 3.2.1
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans)

## Version 3.2.0
- Added handling for bastion turn advancement when prompting rests

## Version 3.1.1
- Fixed bug when consuming last food/water item in stack

## Version 3.1.0
- Added recovery details to Simple Calendar notes, pulled from the rest chat card

## Version 3.0.7
- Fixed song of rest sometimes rolling 11 dice instead of 1 die

## Version 3.0.6
- Fixed some broken localization
- Fixed `game.user.isGM` being called too early in some cases

## Version 3.0.5
- Version bump for 4.3.x

## Version 3.0.4
- Fixed hit die buffer not working properly
- Fixed Arcane Recovery, Natural Recovery, and Song of Rest sometimes not working properly

## Version 3.0.3
- Fixed certain flags showing up in recovery message (food/water sated flags, short rests remaining, etc)

## Version 3.0.2
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans)

## Version 3.0.1
- Fixed bug where setting item/feat recovery to anything except "Full" would sometimes result in unexpected recovery amounts

## Version 3.0.0
- Updated to make use of 4.2.0's changes (this means 4.2.0 is the new minimum version for this and future updates)
- Updated to be compatible with V13 (probably); obviously does not _require_ V13 as it is not yet a stable release
- Removed much custom rest message handling, as the system now automatically reports all recovery/spending during rests
- Removed handling for "Power Surge," as (technically as of 4.0.0) this can be handled strictly by the system
- Fixed "Recharge" items not recharging on rest
- Fixed bug where non-GM users could sometimes automatically try (& fail) to set a tidy5e setting on login
- Changed the default HD recovery fraction to be "Full" to line up with the modern 5e ruleset. This should not impact any existing settings
- Added recognition for using the non-standard HD recovery fraction (comparing with the system's rules version setting), and displaying the "You're using custom settings" message accordingly

## Version 2.3.2
- Fixed other resters sometimes not being picked up for effects like Song of Rest or Chef

## Version 2.3.1
- Amendment to previous fix of Natural Recovery; since the 2024 version also allows a free casting, there may be multiple activities. To specify which represents the spell recovery, a new localization option has been added in the "Feature Names" section of settings for the Activity name in question. This will only be checked if the main "Natural Recovery" item does _not_ itself have limited uses

## Version 2.3.0
- Added `promptRest(userActors, longRest, newDay)` to API and updated API docs
- Fixed Song of Rest referring to the 3.x version of the damage field for custom healing - in 4.x, should have a "Heal" activity with the desired formula as the healing formula
- Fixed Arcane Recovery and Natural Recovery referring to the 3.x version of the "other formula" field - in 4.x, should have a "Utility" activity with the desired formula as the roll formula

## Version 2.2.0
- Updated to use new 4.1+ roll hooks (this means 4.1.0 is the new minimum version for this and future updates)

## Version 2.1.5
- Version bump and css fix for One D&D Exhaustion

## Version 2.1.4
- Fixed an error when consuming food/water which has only a quantity, rather than limited uses

## Version 2.1.3
- Fixed an error with One D&D Exhaustion not properly setting its reference journal

## Version 2.1.2
- Fixed an error with dynamic maximum uses
- Fixed some typos (thanks SagaTympana!)

## Version 2.1.1
- One D&D Exhaustion now properly removes normal system exhaustion behavior
- Water item provided in PHB now recognized and patches as a Rest Recovery-compatible water item automatically

## Version 2.1.0
- Tidy5e integration
- Changed currency conversion to (hopefully) be currency-customization friendly

## Version 2.0.2
- Fixed attunement check for periapt of wound closure (in 4.x)

## Version 2.0.1
- Fixed food/water consumption during rests not properly registering

## Version 2.0.0
- Now compatible with dnd5e 4.0.0
- No longer compatible with v11 or dnd5e 3.x
- Consumption options for food & water are now more streamlined; Rest Recovery will add subtypes to the "food" consumable type for "food", "water", or "both." There is no longer a "Is Consumable" checkbox - if a "food" type consumable shouldn't be considered as such by Rest Recovery, simply do not give it a subtype
- "One D&D Exhaustion" remains an option. If unchecked, debuffs from exhaustion will continue to be handled by a combination of Rest Recovery and the system in the case of the "Legacy" ruleset, or will be handled entirely by the system with the "Modern" ruleset
- Recovery options in the system have been greatly improved in 4.0, leading to the removal of the following features from Rest Recovery:
  - Item/Feat/Daily "uses recovery fraction" settings no longer accept custom formulae. The system allows for this on a per-item basis. They still accept multipliers, which are applied on whatever the system's calculation would be. For example, if an item has a custom recovery formula of `@item.uses.max / 2` on a Short Rest in its details tab, and you set "Item uses recovery fraction" to "Half" on a given rest profile, that item will regain 1/4 of its maximum uses on a short rest
  - There is no more "Custom Recovery Formula" input on items, the system handles this fully

## Version 1.17.1
- Fixed attunement check for periapt of wound closure

## Version 1.17.0
- Added compatibility with group sheet rests (they'll now open the "Prompt Rest" dialog with all actors from the sheet selected by default)
- This will _actually_ be the last v11/3.x-compatible release

## Version 1.16.3
- Added localization for small version of Item Piles trade button
- NOTE: Barring any bugs discovered prior to the dnd5e 4.0.0 release, this will likely be the final V11 & dnd5e 3.x compatible release.

## Version 1.16.2
- Fixed bug where Rest Recovery would try to access Tidy5e's settings before they were registered
- Fixed a bug where rolling hit dice on long rest wouldn't update the UI
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans)

## Version 1.16.1
- Fixed bug where Tidy5e sheet would be adjusted even if exhaustion automation was disabled in Rest Recovery

## Version 1.16.0
- Added a special trait for actors to roll hit dice with advantage
- Added a whispered chat message to the GM if Rest Recovery changes Tidy5e's exhaustion display settings
- Added an API function which might be useful for programmatically handling food/water consumption
- Added a system version max of "4" to prevent activation on dnd5e 4.0.0 when it releases, as Rest Recovery almost certainly won't be immediately compatible

## Version 1.15.1
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans)

## Version 1.15.0
- Added settings in food & water section to enable or disable food/water requirement according to "new day"
  - If enabled, food & water consumption will be a rest step regardless of short vs long rest, so long as the rest results in a new day
  - Note that if food & water _exhaustion_ is enabled along with this setting, normal exhaustion recovery will occur on long rests, but will also occur on short rests which span a new day (if all food/water required is consumed)
- Use Custom Recovery checkbox & formula will now only show on items when relevant (uses set to short/long rest or "day")
- Fixed a bug where playing with a non-english translation could cause food/water costs to be improperly calculated
- Fixed a bug where actors with "default ownership" of owner wouldn't show up in the rest prompt

## Version 1.14.1
- Fixed a bug where regular exhaustion rules were applied still when Alternative Exhaustion 5e was active
- Fixed a bug where Song of Rest wasn't being applied to players' actors unless the player also owned the bard
- Fixed the chat message displayed for Song of Rest to properly use whatever the configured "Song of Rest" name is
- Fixed a bug where rests called through a macro with `{dialog: false}` would not recover any resources
  - Now such a rest will complete as if there were no food/water restrictions as no player input can be collected without a dialog
  - Similarly, if "spell slot point-like recovery rule" is enabled and a no-dialog rest is prompted via macro, spell slots will be recovered according to the custom formula

## Version 1.14.0
- Added compatibility with [Magic Items](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/magicitems) module (resting should now recharge magic items as appropriate)
  - This relies on Magic Items version 4.1.7 or later
- Added an option to only log Simple Calendar notes if coming from a GM-prompted rest (i.e. not from a rest starting on a character sheet)
- Fixed a bug with chat messages for hp regain on short rests displaying incorrect recovery amount

## Version 1.13.0
- Added option for hp regain on short rests (in addition to hit dice rolls)
- A couple of dialog fixes

## Version 1.12.2
- "Configure Resource Recovery" option now only shows up on default sheet if sheet is in edit mode

## Version 1.12.1
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans & VirusNik21)
  - Now includes Russian translation

## Version 1.12.0
- Added option to allow Song of Rest to roll with _every_ short rest hit die rolled, rather than only the first

## Version 1.11.5
- Fixed a bug which sometimes prevented Midi QOL from opening its troubleshooter

## Version 1.11.4
- Fixed bug when trying to prompt rest with non-actor tokens on the scene

## Version 1.11.3
- Fixed NPC rests when using Tidy (only from their sheet - still don't support adding them in a prompted rest)
  - Due to improvements made to NPC actor data in dnd5e v3.2.0, NPCs should now mostly be able to benefit from the full Rest Recovery workflow; in dnd5e v3.1.x, however, NPC rests will simply use the core rest methods

## Version 1.11.2
- Actors with tokens on the viewed scene will now appear at the top of the rest prompt list dropdown
- Selected actors for a rest prompt are now remembered across browsers
  - The data will be stored on the user who prompts the rest, upon modifying the selected actors or initiating a rest from the prompt
- Removed some deprecation warnings

## Version 1.11.1
- Updated chat message flavor to reflect custom rest times

## Version 1.11.0
- Added a the ability to configure hit die rolls to be done with advantage, or automatically maxed (thanks f4hy on github!)
- Moved the fractional hp recovery from HD rolls to the general tab, as it effects all hit die rolls, not only those taken during short rests

## Version 1.10.4
- Fixed a forge-only bug when enabling One D&D Exhaustion

## Version 1.10.3
- Fixed a bunch of small bugs relating to various resource/spell recoveries that were introduced in version 1.8.0

## Version 1.10.2
- Updated fractional hp recovery from HD rolls to use the same dropdown as Periapt of Wound Closure's dropdown for how to multiply hit die rolls

## Version 1.10.1
- Removed libwrapper dependency
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans!)

## Version 1.10.0
- Added an option for fractional hp recovery from hit die rolls (e.g. all HD rolls are halved, quartered, or auto-zero; bonuses - like CON mod - are not multiplied)

## Version 1.9.1
- Fixed a bug where food/water-related special traits wouldn't show up unless world was reloaded

## Version 1.9.0
- Now _fully_ implements RAW exhaustion - in addition to the existing speed & hp max decreases, the appropriate rolls will receive disadvantage at certain exhaustion levels
  - Ability Checks (including skill checks) will receive disadvantage if at exhaustion 1 or above
  - Attack Rolls and Saving Throws (including concentration saves & death saves) will receive disadvantage if at exhaustion 3 or above
  - The above only applies if One D&D Exhaustion is not enabled
  - If "fast-forwarding" rolls, this will happen automatically, rolling with disadvantage, or as a straight roll if it was determined by some other module (or by holding down a keybind) that the roll should have advantage for some reason
  - Otherwise, in roll dialog, the appropriate option (again, either disadvantage or normal) will be highlighted
- Added automatic support for [Automated Conditions 5e](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/automated-conditions-5e) - if installed & AC5e exhaustion automation is enabled, Rest Recovery will let AC5e handle the effects (unless Rest Recovery is set to use One D&D Exhaustion).

## Version 1.8.0
- Should now be V12 and dnd5e 3.2 compatible while maintaining V11 & 3.1.x functionality

## Version 1.7.0
- Updated TyphonJS and Svelte to more current releases, should see no change in user experience, but maybe some improved performance
- Fixed an error being logged to console every time the settings menu was opened

## Version 1.6.9.4
- Fixed (one) error logged to console on world startup

## Version 1.6.9.3
- Fixed bug where world would restart & UI would become unusable after trying to save settings (HUGE thanks to Christopher on discord)

## Version 1.6.9.2
- Fixed bug where One D&D Exhaustion effect would not be removed if exhaustion on an actor changed after reverting from One D&D to normal exhaustion

## Version 1.6.9.1
- Fixed missing compendium & asset data

## Version 1.6.9
- Added automatic recognition of "Rations (1 day)" imported using DDBI.

## Version 1.6.8
- Added reference journal entry for One D&D Exhaustion condition (in Brazilian Portuguese as well - thanks Kharmans!)

## Version 1.6.7
- Various exhaustion fixes
  - New icons for One D&D Exhaustion levels (thanks mythacri!)
  - The "exhaustion integrations" option is currently disabled, as the only option (DFreds CE) doesn't play nice with any exhaustion automations
    - You can still use CE (and even set effects to "replace" now, if you want), just know that the CE exhaustion effects will not be applied
  - If you use the [Alternative Exhaustion 5e](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/alternative-exhaustion-5e) module, you won't have to/be able to enable One D&D Exhaustion in the Rest Recovery settings (it will already be handled by Alternative Exhaustion)
    - If you currently use Alternative Exhaustion with "Manual Adjustment" enabled, and decide to remove it in favor of only using Rest Recovery, ensure you remove any "Global Bonuses" you have set which rely on exhaustion, as the -1 per exhaustion level is automatically handled by Rest Recovery
  - Fixed an issue where using One D&D Exhaustion resulted in the "normal" exhaustion debuffs happening on top of the expected debuffs

## Version 1.6.6.1
- Made One D&D sheet modification an option, so as not to conflict with other potentially compatible exhaustion modules

## Version 1.6.6
- Added compatibility with "new" 5e actor sheet
  - Now shows resource recovery configuration option above "Favorites" section
  - If One D&D exhaustion exabled, will now have 10 exhaustion pips to click
    - Currently exhaustion 6-10 will show the wrong icon, as there are no core icons for those exhaustion levels (besides 6, which shows a little red skull exhaustion icon)
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans!)

## Version 1.6.5

- Fixed compatibility with Tidy5e sheets
  - Custom resource recovery should now be visible in the traits list in the Attributes tab
  - Enabling/disabling One D&D exhaustion will now enable/disable it for Tidy5e as well (you'll have to save settings at least once if you're already using both Tidy5e and have One D&D exhaustion enabled)
  - Warning will now properly be displayed if a food/water consumable has an invalid number of max charges with food/water automation turned on
  - Custom Recovery checkbox now properly enables the custom recovery formula field
  - Fixed widths of item sheet checkboxes to not cut off text

## Version 1.6.4

- Fixed a bug where consuming the final charge of a food/water item that was set to destroy on empty would not properly update the character's hunger/thirst level
- Added optional cost of fully/half sating hunger and thirst through external sources (e.g. meals/drinks at a tavern)
  - This is currently globally configured, with checkboxes for enabling food & water costs individually, and cost settings for full & half for both
    - Per-scene configuration is unlikely to be implemented, so if you anticipate different costs in the same session I'd recommend creating different rest profiles ahead of time
  - The cost for full or half will be the same regardless of whether the resting characters have already eaten (after all, you don't get a refund for the amount of a meal that you didn't eat)
  - If a character doesn't have enough money to "externally source" the options they've selected, they won't be able to continue the rest until changing their selection to one they can afford
  - The currency will be automatically deducted from the character's inventory, performing currency conversions only when necessary

## Version 1.6.3

- Added new "Custom" rest variant, accessible via the Quick Setup menu in the variant dropdown
  - Selecting this variant will allow you to enter your own custom Long & Short Rest lengths in the Quick Setup menu
  - Lengths are variable down to the nearest 0.05 hours (3 minutes)

## Version 1.6.2

- Removed branding from General Settings
- Added setting that when enabled logs all rests as Simple Calendar notes (requires player permissions for "Create Journal Entries" and Simple Calendar "Add Notes")

## Version 1.6.1

- Fixed spell slots being removed when taking a long rest with "Enable spell slot point-like recovery rule" enabled.

## Version 1.6.0

- Tweaked rests that are prompted by GMs to now only consider the prompted characters when determining active features such as Song of Rest and the Chef feat

- Fixed food & water not showing up in the rest dialog if the character didn't need water but needed food
- Turned off exhaustion integrations when One D&D Exhaustion is active due to strange behavior
- Fixed One D&D Exhaustion referencing MidiQOL flags instead of native D&D flags

## Version 1.4.10
- Added support for the War Wizard's Power Surge feature
- Fixed hit dice recovery fraction not being respected when long rest hit dice rolling was not enabled

- Fixed error when opening the short rest UI when Simple Calendar was active

## Version 1.4.2
- Added support for flags that prevents long and short rests - thank you sasquach45932 for the contribution!
  - Requires you to use DAE or a macro to set these flags on the actor:
    - `flags.dae.rest-recovery.prevent.longRest`
    - `flags.dae.rest-recovery.prevent.shortRest`
  - With DAE, you can use `flags.dae` as the attribute key and `rest-recovery.prevent.[shortRest/longRest] 1` as the value to prevent the rest
- Added `ignoreFlags` secondary argument to `Actor#longRest` and `Actor#shortRest` to ignore the aforementioned behavior 

## Version 1.4.1

- Added Simple Calendar support, prompting rests now automatically advances the current date & time
- Added One D&D exhaustion support, and integrated custom active effect into DFred's Conventient Effects

- Improved the long/short rest UI; removed tabs and introduced steps to better inform users of things they might want to do
- Fixed error where a player with a 1st level bard without the Song of Rest feature would throw an error every time another player would roll a hit die

## Version 1.3.10
